# Parity violation
# Helicity = spin projection along momentum axis
# One defines also Chirality which tends to be ~ the helicity in
# the ultrarelativistic limit

# The chirality of a particle is more abstract: It is determined by whether the
# particle transforms in a right- or left-handed representation of the PoincarÃ©
# group. Chirality can be left handed or right handed.

# Only left handed particles and right handed antiparticles are
# involved in weak interaction
