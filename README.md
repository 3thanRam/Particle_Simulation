# Particle_Simulation
by Ethan RAMSEY

This started as a project at Strasbourg university 2022-23, with Stanislas LAMBERT, Jules FAVREL, with the objective to demonstrate the effect of a critical number of dimensions on the particle/antiparticle densities, but I've continued to add new features in order to generalise and improve it.

Simulation of the trajectories &amp; collisions of subatomic particles when trapped in a N dimensional box.

Takes into account: Electric force generated by other particles,Particle-Antiparticle Annihilations, Particle-Antiparticle creations (with unrealistic probabilities), photon absorption

Supported particles (as well as antiparticles for fermions): electron,muon,tau,photon

Choice between only showing evolution of the particles' densities or also visualise their trajectories.


To do: 

-Redo comments

-Strong & weak nuclear forces

-Relativistic dynamic boundaries
